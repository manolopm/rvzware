This IS NOT the original libwms. This libwms has been adapted by
capaware team to capaware and modified by Manuel Padrón Martínez to be
used in rvzware fork.

libwms requires:
- curl
- expat


//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Begin linux build notes:

On machines with yum you can do:

As root:

# yum install curl curl-devel expat expat-devel

Or with sudo:

$ sudo yum install curl curl-devel expat expat-devel

If you do not have yum find the appropriate rpms or packages.

End linux build notes

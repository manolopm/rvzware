Rvzware version 0.001

This software is based in CAPAware 3D software
(https://web.archive.org/web/20180228223106/http://www.capaware.org/).

CAPAware is now a dead project. 
Rvzware pretends to be a multiplatform and Qt based fork. Maybe I'll try to
fix some issues and make in others way some parts of code.
